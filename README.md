## 🚀 Run the Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Build and run the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. The backend will start at:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

📌 **Note:** The project uses an **in-memory database (H2)**, so you don’t need to install MySQL or PostgreSQL.
The database is automatically created and populated at runtime.

## 💻 Run the Frontend (Angular)

1. Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Angular development server:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
4. Open the application in your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

## ⚡ Usage Flow

1. Start the **backend** first (Spring Boot).
2. Then start the **frontend** (Angular).
3. Access the app via your browser at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
4. The frontend communicates with the backend running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
